== Welcome to the Myousica infrastructure documentation

The myousica application is a RESTful Rails 2.0 app that implements an open platform for
creating and composing music online. The whole myousica infrastructure is composed of:

* This RESTful app;
* The multitrack-server app, located on github at http://github.com/vjt/multitrack-server;
* 4 SWF components that consume the services of both apps, located on github;
* Flash Media Server 3, that interacts with the multitrack-server app and the multitrack.

This app implements most of the business logic, while the multitrack-server one handles file
uploads and MP3 encoding and downmixing using ffmpeg (http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu) and sox
(http://sox.sf.net).
